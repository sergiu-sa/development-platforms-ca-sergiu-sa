# This file ensures the routes folder is tracked by Git
# Empty folders are ignored by Git, so we add this placeholder
#
# In Phase 2, this folder will contain:
# - auth.ts    (registration and login routes)
# - articles.ts (article CRUD routes)
#
# You can delete this file once you add actual route files
